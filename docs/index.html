    <p><b>Gomoku</b> (also known as 5-in-a-row) is a simple two-player strategy game, traditionally played on a <i>Go</i> board. Players take turns to place their counters on the grid.</p>
    <p>The winner is the first player to join <i>exactly five</i> of their counters in row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This version allows you play an AI opponent, with starting player assigned randomly. </p>
    
    <p>
    The following rules are applied to mitigate Black's first-turn advantage:<br/>
    - Black moves first, and must play the centre square.<br />
    - White moves next and can play any sqaure.<br />
    - Black moves next but may not play within the central 5x5 area of the board.<br />
    - The game continues with players taking turns to play any remaining vacant position, until one player has exactly five counters in a row.
    </p>
    
    <p>Note: The AI is not an expert player. The purpose of the app was mainly to try out web development using the Dart programming language.
